# Katas

This repository is designed as a collector of katas and my personal solutions to them. The languages for the solution can be very different (for now my favourites are Java and Scala) and every folder contains the description and a lot of sub-folders with the solution in the chosen language

Feel free to use this repo at your pleasure
